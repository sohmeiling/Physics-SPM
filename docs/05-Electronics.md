## Electron

All materials are composed of atoms (made up of nucleus and surrounded by electrons). At different shells, the electrons possess different energy level.

### Thermionic Emission

Thermionic emission is the emission of electrons from a heated metal with high level of thermal energy.

At room temperature, the energy processed by the electrons in the metal is insufficient for thermionic emission. When a metal is heated, the electrons gain thermal energy. The increase in thermal energy leads to the increase of kinetic energy. Once sufficient thermal energy is supplied to the metal, the electrons gain enough energy to overcome the force of attraction between proton in the nucleus and electrons. Thus, the electrons escape to become free electrons.

There are **four** factors that affect the rate of thermionic emission.

-   **The temperature of the metal**

    -   As the temperature of the metal increases, the emission rate of electrons also increases.

-   **The total surface area of the metal**

    -   As the total surface area of the metal increases, the emission rate of electrons also increases.

-   **The type of metal**

    -   Different type of metals emits electrons at different rates.

-   **The coating on the surface of the metal**

    -   A layer coating of barium oxide (BaO) or strontium oxide(SrO) increases the rate of thermionic emission.

Here's a short video from Youtube about thermionic emission.

### Cathode Ray

The characteristics of cathode ray include:

1.  Cathode ray is a negatively-charged electron beam.

2.  Cathode ray can be deflected by the electric field.

3.  cathode ray can be deflected by the magnetic field. The direction of deflection can be determined by the Fleming's Left-hand Rule.

4.  Cathode ray moves in a straight line and form a sharp shadow.

5.  Cathode ray moves at high speed (high kinetic energy).

6.  Cathode ray can produce a fluorescent effect when the electron beam hits the fluorescent screen.

### Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)

It will be great if you can learn how to draw the CRO. It will help you to be familiarize with the electron gun, deflection system, and fluorosecence screen that make up the CRO.

See the great video below by alharony in youtube about CRO.
